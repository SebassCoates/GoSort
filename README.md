# GoSort

This project primarily exists as a way for me to learn Go and develop my 
understanding of sorting algorithms and concurrency. I'll use goroutines often
(perhaps excessively) for this reason.

Anyone also learning Go, concurrency, or sorting should feel free to contribute
to this repository.
